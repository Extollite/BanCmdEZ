# KillingReward

Simple mod for [ElementZero](https://github.com/Element-0/ElementZero).<br><br>
Actually this name is not really correct because it is adding money reward for killing mobs 
but also adding /back, /wild and /suicide command.<br>
This mod should be treated as some Custom EZ mod example.

Config
-------------
```
  KllingReward:
    enabled: true
    killingMoney:
      Chicken: 1
      Creeper: 3
```
